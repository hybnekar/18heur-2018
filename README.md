# About Heuristics 2018

Repository accompanying the 2018 Heuristics course at Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

## Structure of the repository

* `classes/` folder contains files with all the materials related to the classes, mostly Jupyter notebooks, organized as `YYYYMMDD-*.{ipynb,py}` where `YYYYMMDD` is date of the class and:
   * IPYNB file contains an Jupyter (IPython) notebook - it can be rendered directly on GitHub or opened locally in Jupyter,
   * PY contains plain text Python source code version of the notebook - only because it can be easily reviewed or referenced in e.g. a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
* `src/` folder contains all source codes which can be imported and re-used.
